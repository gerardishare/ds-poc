**DSSC Description**

Data space intermediaries supports a data space to make business and governance decisions related to data space intermediaries.

Data space intermediaries provide enabling services to the data space governance authority and participants. Examples of enabling services include identity, observability, catalogue, and connector services. In business modelling, the data space can rely on external intermediaries instead of providing all enabling services ‘in-house’. The intermediaries may specialise in delivering the same services to multiple data spaces.
