**DSSC Description**

A value-added service in a data space is a service that enables, for the data space participants, value generation on top of data transactions. These services can be seen as structured capabilities made available within a data space and providing value to its users by facilitating specific tasks, processes, or functions that these users need, directly or indirectly, for their operations.

This type of service complements data space enabling services (in their aim to provide a core function for the governance authority and enable data transactions between participants), generating additional value in the data space according to the defined business model and supporting this value generation through the use cases.
