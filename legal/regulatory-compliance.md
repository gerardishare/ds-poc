**DSSC Description**

Regulatory compliance encompasses a range of activities designed to ensure that the relevant regulatory frameworks are adhered to, and is an ongoing practice throughout the lifecycle of the data space. These activities include embedding various elements and functions of the data space within the regulatory landscape, guiding the Data Space Governance Authority and participants on the relevance of EU values and different regulations, addressing roles and responsibilities among participants, creating internal policies for regulatory compliance, and continuously monitoring compliance throughout the life cycle of a data space.

Key elements of this building block include mapping and analysing legal provisions specifically applicable to data spaces, and understanding the legal dimension of the key elements (such as data and actors/participants) that every data space contains.
