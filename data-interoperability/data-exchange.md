**DSSC Description**

In terms of data exchange the conceptual model of a data space has two different planes. The control plane and the data plane. First plane manages the conditions to allow the data interchange performed in the second level. These conditions include, not exhaustively, the trusted identification of the participants, the granted permissions for the participants to interchange data and of course that the contractual conditions between the participants organizations are met. In the second plane data interchange is performed according to agreed mechanisms, usually Application Program Interfaces, offered across the data space.

The data exchange building block focuses on data transmission once the previous conditions for interchange authorisation are met. It operates in the data plane once the control plane has enabled data sharing.
