**DSSC Description**

Data models ensure that data is accurately and consistently interpreted when being exchanged within a data space. The model provides semantics and a shared vocabulary. Such models are relevant between two participants within a data space that want to exchange data. When using the same data model, semantic interoperability becomes possible.

Semantic interoperability is also important for other elements in a data space, for example, for expressing the contents of usage policies or describing data offerings. Also, a well-defined data model is essential for these (meta-)data transfers.

A data model is a structured representation of data elements and relationships used to facilitate semantic interoperability within and across domains. However, there are different abstraction levels for data models. This building block distinguishes between the various types of data models and the meta-standards in which they can be expressed while also providing examples.

Additionally, this building block describes how these data models can be managed, by whom, and what tooling can assist in this process. Finally, four critical design choices are described to implement and manage data models in a data space.
